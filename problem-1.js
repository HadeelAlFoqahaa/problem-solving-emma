* Also, We can use the Set Object like the following function,

*
    * function getCharsFromStrings(arrOfStrings) {
    *   const chars = arrOfStrings.join(' ').split('');
    *   return [...new Set(chars)];
    * }
*
* Set Object, from MDN doc:
*   The Set has method checks if a value is in a Set object,
*   using an approach that is, on average,
*   quicker than testing most of the elements
*   that have previously been added to the Set object.
*   In particular, it is, on average,
*   faster than the Array.prototype.includes method when an Array object has a length equal to a Set objectâ€™s size.

/*
*   * This another way to return unique values but I assumed that it's complexity is more than my way
*      cause in filter we're looping n times and in indexOf we have another loop, so each loop has another loop:
*     * function getCharsFromStrings(arrOfStrings) {
        * const chars = arrOfStrings.join(' ').split('');
        * let uniqueChars = chars.filter((c, index) => {
        *     return chars.indexOf(c) === index;
        * });
        * return uniqueChars;
